# Dendritic excitability controls overdispersion

## Figure 1 & Supp. Figure 2

- Data for figure 1 is generated by running simulations.py
- Functions used by simulations.py are defined in dendritic_renewal.py
- After the data has been generated, plotting_functions.py will generate Figures 1b-d and dendritic_modulation_heatmaps.ipydb will generate Figures 1f-h

Generating the data will take a long time. In particular the the data for the heatmaps will take a few days. If you want to generate some data, I would suggest only running figure1_data() from simulations.py. 

## Figure 2

- Data and figures are generated by running two_compartment_LIF.ipynb

## Figure 3 & Supp. Figure 2

- Data and figures for in vitro data were generated using cv_analysis_larkum_data.ipynb'
- Data and figure for in vivo data were generates using cv_data_analysis_Grienberger.ipynb
- Data is available upon request and permission from the data owners

## Supp. Figure 1

- Figures can be gernerated by running BAP_investigation.ipynb

## Supp. Figure 3

- Figures can be generated by running RNN_model_extenion.ipynb
