# Dendritic excitability controls overdispersion

## Figure 1 & Supplementary Figure 3

- Data for figure 1 is generated by running simulations.py
- Functions used by simulations.py are defined in dendritic_renewal.py
- After the data has been generated, plotting_functions.py will generate Figures 1b-d
- Data and Figure 1f-h are generated by running two_compartment_LIF.ipynb

Generating the data will take a long time. In particular the the data for the heatmaps will take a few days. If you want to regernerate the data, I would suggest running the code locally as you will hit the compute quota offered by code ocean.

## Extended Data Figure 1

- Data is also generated by running simulations.py (same function as Figure 1)
- dendritic_modulation_heatmaps.ipydb will generate Extended Data Figures 1b-d


## Figure 2 & Supplementary Figure 2

- Data and figures for in vitro data were generated using cv_analysis_larkum_data.ipynb'
- Data and figure for in vivo data were generates using cv_data_analysis_Grienberger.ipynb
- Data is available upon request and permission from the data owners

## Supplementary Figure 1

- Figures can be gernerated by running BAP_investigation.ipynb


## Supplementary Figure 4

- Figures can be generated by running RNN_model_extenion.ipynb
